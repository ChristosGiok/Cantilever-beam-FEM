# CE-UY 3013 Computing In Civil Engineering Project: FEM - Cantilever beam


This program is intended to help engineering students with projects and assignments using the finite element method.

### FEM based analysis of cantilever beam:
It takes s, p, xp, w, E, b, d as an argument and calculates the deflection, shear force and bending moments at each node.

* Please see Inputs/Sketch.png for input details
#  The values the user must input are: 
1. S: The length of the beam.
2. P: The applied force acting on the beam.
3. xp: The distance from the fixed end to the applied force P.
4. w: The distributed load on the beam. Wself.
5. E: The modulus of elasticity of the chosen material.
6. b: The width of the beam.
7. d: The depth of the beam.

# Solved Example. 
#s,p,xp,w,E,b,d == 10,200,3,50,200000000000,0.02,0.06

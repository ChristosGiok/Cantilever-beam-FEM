# CE-UY 3013 Computing In Civil Engineering Project: FEM - Cantilever beam


#  This program is intended to help engineering students with projects and assignments using the finite element method.

#This program is designed to analyze a cantilever beam using FEM and output graphs of:
#1. Delflection 
#2. Shear force 
#3. Bending moment 

#  The values the user must input are: 
#1. S: The length of the beam.
#2. P: The applied force acting on the beam.
#3. xp: The distance from the fixed end to the applied force P.
#4. w: The distributed load on the beam. Wself.
#5. E: The modulus of elasticity of the chosen material.
#6. b: The width of the beam.
#7. d: The depth of the beam.

# Solved Example. 
#s,p,xp,w,E,b,d
#10,200,3,50,200000000000,0.02,0.06

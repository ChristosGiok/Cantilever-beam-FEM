# Cantilever-beam-FEM
#This is the final project for CE-UY 3013 Computing In Civil Engineering.

#This program is intended to help engineering students with projects and assignments using the finite element method.

#This program is designed to analyze a cantilever beam using FEM and outputs graphs representing:
# 1. Delflection 
# 2. Shear force 
# 3. Bending moment 

#The values the user must input are: 
# 1. S: The length of the beam.
# 2. P: The applied force acting on the beam.
# 3. xp: The distance from the fixed end to the applied force P.
# 4. w: The distributed load on the beam. Wself.
# 5. E: The modulus of elasticity of the chosen material.
# 6. b: The width of the beam.
# 7. d: The depth of the beam.

# Functions used
